  - If you are not familiar with this and you are Linux or Mac user, just use your default terminal app.



# Instructions

## Run the codes and test them.

- After making sure you have prepared all the environments, you only need to do one thing.

1. For Windows user, open your `git bash` and `cd` to this folder (or open `git bash` in the folder) and type in `bash _setup.sh` and press enter.
2. For Linux or Mac user, open your terminal and `cd` to this folder and type in `bash _setup.sh` and press enter.

- Then you should see following logs:

```
You are supposed to run this scrips with bash!
Start compiling algorithm codes!
Done!
Start generating test data!
Done!
Start testing codes! Don't edit output.txt!
Check out the answer while N = 5!
Accept!
Check out the answer while N = 10!
Accept!
Check out the answer while N = 15!
Accept!
......
```

## Clear useless files.

- Everything is the same except run the `_clear.sh` instead of `_setup.sh`.
